# markov-fit
Tests of fit for general order Markov chains assuming prior information on the transitions.

Type_1_and_2_errors_gof_ord1.R contains code for testing the goodness-of-fit for general order Markov chains by assuming prior information on the transitions. 

Type_1_and_2_errors_hom_ord1.R contains code for testing the homogeneity between general order Markov chains by assuming prior information on the transitions. 

Genome Data.R contains rRNA data from: 

Ababneh, F., Jermiin, L. S., Ma, C. and Robinson, J. (2006). Matched-pairs tests of homogeneity with applications to homologous nucleotid sequences. Bioinormatics 22, 1225-1231.
